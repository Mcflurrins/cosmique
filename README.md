### Explain what are stateless widgets and stateful widgets, and explain the difference between them.
Stateful widgets make up parts of the Flutter application's user interface which are more dynamic and can change its appearance in response to events triggered by user interactions or when it receives data. The widget's State is then stored in a State object to separate the widget's state from its appearance, and this State consists of values that can change. Example: Slider, Form. Stateless widgets on the other hand, are static and do not have changes in state. While they may change in appearance ever so slightly, they do not have a separately stored State object that allows them to be dynamic. Example: Icon, Text.

### Mention the widgets that you have used for this project and its uses. 
1. MaterialApp: Wraps the entire application and provides necessary material design functionality like theming, navigation, and localization.
2. Material: A widget that introduces the Material Design visual style, giving widgets like buttons and text fields their material appearance like elevation effects, shadows.
3. InkWell: A rectangular area that responds to touch, often used to wrap other widgets like buttons or images to make them tappable with ripple effects on touch.
4. Scaffold: Provides a basic layout structure for the visual interface of the screen, including standard elements like an app bar, body, floating action button, bottom navigation, and drawers.
5. AppBar: A material design app bar that typically holds titles, icons, and actions at the top of a screen, often used inside a Scaffold.
6. SnackBar: A lightweight message bar that briefly shows messages at the bottom of the screen, often used to inform users about the result of actions theyâ€™ve taken.
7. SingleChildScrollView: A scrollable widget that allows its single child to scroll vertically or horizontally, useful when the content might not fit on a single screen.
8. SizedBox: A box with a fixed size, often used to add space between widgets or to define specific dimensions for a widget.
9. Column: A layout widget that arranges its children vertically, useful for stacking widgets in a vertical direction.
10. GridView: A scrollable, 2D array of widgets, useful for displaying a large number of items (like images or icons) in a grid format.
11. Padding: A widget that insets its child by the specified padding values on each side, used to control spacing around a widget.
12. Text: A widget that displays a string of text with a customizable style.
13. Icon: A widget that displays a graphical symbol from the material design library or other icon sets.

### What is the use-case for setState()? Explain the variable that can be affected by setState().
The setState() method in Flutter is used within stateful widgets to trigger a UI rebuild when the widget's state changes. It updates variables that affect the UI, such as counters, colors, or text, by marking the widget tree for redrawing. Typically, it is used to modify state variables (defined within the State class) in response to user interactions or other dynamic events, ensuring the UI reflects the updated values. However, only the logic for updating the state should go inside setState(), and it should not be used for long-running tasks.

### Explain the difference between const and final keyword.
The const keyword declares compile time constants, while the final keyword declares run time constants. This means that a variable declared with the const keyword is initialized at compile-time and is already assigned a value by the time the program runs, while a variable declared with the final keyword is initialized at run-time and can only be assigned for a single time after the program runs. For example, you can use final when you don't know what the value of a variable is during compile-time, like when you need to store data from an API in a variable, this only happens when your code is already running.

### Explain how you implemented the checklist above step-by-step.

#### 1. Make the Flutter App
First, we can create a new Flutter app by running the following commands in the terminal. This initializes a new directory with the name of the app (cosmique in this case), complete with the basic files needed to launch and run a demo of the app.

```
flutter create cosmmique
cd cosmique
```

### 2. Configure main.dart
We can import the following package into our main.html so that we can use Flutter widgets implementing Material Design in our application.
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```
After that, make a new file called menu.dart in the lib folder for implementing extra widgets separately into our app so that we don't overcrowd too many things in just one file. Then, import that dart file into main.dart. Along with that, we can hide the debug banner by setting debugShowCheckedModeBanner to false, then, we can configure the color palette of our app in the theme section. In here, I'm configuring the primary swatch to grey, then setting the secondary color to grey[900]. Make sure the useMaterial3 feature is checked true, to use the latest version of Google's Material Design.

All in all, alter the main.dart to look like below.
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:cosmique/menu.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Cosmique',
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSwatch(
       primarySwatch: Colors.grey,
 ).copyWith(secondary: Colors.grey[900]),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: MyHomePage(),
    );
  }
```

### 3. Make the Item Home Page Widget

In menu.dart, make a new ItemHomepage class to contain information to pass through to the other widgets we might want to make. This class will take on 3 constants, a string object, an iconData object, and a color object. The constructor ItemHomepage(this.name, this.icon, this.iconColor); is a special method used to create instances of the ItemHomepage class. The this keyword refers to the current instance of the class, allowing the constructor parameters (name, icon, and iconColor) to be assigned directly to the class's instance variables without needing to use explicit assignments like this.name = name;.
```
class ItemHomepage {
     final String name;
     final IconData icon;
     final Color iconColor;

     ItemHomepage(this.name, this.icon, this.iconColor);
 }
```

### 4. Make the Item Card Widget
Then we can make an ItemCard class which returns a Material widget that is clickable because it is wrapped in an Inkwell. When the inkwell, is tapped, a snack bar will appear to display a text that says which button has been pressed.
```

class ItemCard extends StatelessWidget {
  // Display the card with an icon and name.

  final ItemHomepage item; 
  
  const ItemCard(this.item, {super.key}); 

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Material(
      // Specify the background color of the application theme.
      color: item.iconColor,
      // Round the card border.
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
      
      child: InkWell(
        // Action when the card is pressed.
        onTap: () {
          // Display the SnackBar message when the card is pressed.
          ScaffoldMessenger.of(context)
            ..hideCurrentSnackBar()
            ..showSnackBar(
              SnackBar(content: Text("You have pressed the ${item.name} button!"))
            );
        },
        // Container to store the Icon and Text
        child: Container(
          padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
          child: Center(
            child: Column(
              // Place the Icon and Text in the center of the card.
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
              children: [
                Icon(
                  item.icon,
                  color: Colors.white,
                  size: 30.0,
                ),
                const Padding(padding: EdgeInsets.all(3)),
                Text(
                  item.name,
                  textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                  style: const TextStyle(color: Colors.white),
                ),
              ],
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```



### 5. Make the Info Card Widget
We also make an InfoCard class which returns a Card widget and displays a title and a content text in a container.
```
class InfoCard extends StatelessWidget {
  // Card information that displays the title and content.

  final String title;  // Card title.
  final String content;  // Card content.

  const InfoCard({super.key, required this.title, required this.content});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      // Create a card box with a shadow.
      elevation: 2.0,
      child: Container(
        // Set the size and spacing within the card.
        width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width / 3.5, // Adjust with the width of the device used.
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        // Place the title and content vertically.
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Text(
              title,
              style: const TextStyle(fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 8.0),
            Text(content),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```

### 6. Displaying the Widgets
Lastly, in menu.dart, we can display all the widgets we have made in a class MyHomePage, which returns a Scaffold. We pass the information that we want to display in our widgets and adjust how they are arranged in here. 
```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  final String npm = '2306171713'; // NPM
  final String name = 'Flori Andrea Ng'; // Name
  final String className = 'KKI'; // Class
  final List<ItemHomepage> items = [
         ItemHomepage("View Product", Icons.mood, Colors.lightBlue),
         ItemHomepage("Add Product", Icons.add, Colors.orange),
         ItemHomepage("Logout", Icons.logout, Colors.pink),
     ];
  MyHomePage({super.key});

    @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Scaffold provides the basic structure of the page with the AppBar and body.
    return Scaffold(
      // AppBar is the top part of the page that displays the title.
      appBar: AppBar(
        // The title of the application "Mental Health Tracker" with white text and bold font.
        title: const Text(
          'COSMIQUE',
          style: TextStyle(
            color: Colors.white,
            fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
          ),
        ),
        // The background color of the AppBar is obtained from the application theme color scheme.
        backgroundColor: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.secondary,
      ),
      // Body of the page with paddings around it.
      body: SingleChildScrollView( 
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        // Place the widget vertically in a column.
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
          children: [
            // Row to display 3 InfoCard horizontally.
            Row(
              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
              children: [
                InfoCard(title: 'NPM', content: npm),
                InfoCard(title: 'Name', content: name),
                InfoCard(title: 'Class', content: className),
              ],
            ),

            // Give a vertical space of 16 units.
            const SizedBox(height: 16.0),

            // Place the following widget in the center of the page.
            Center(
              child: Column(
                // Place the text and grid item vertically.

                children: [
                  // Display the welcome message with bold font and size 18.
                  const Padding(
                    padding: EdgeInsets.only(top: 16.0),
                    child: Text(
                      'Welcome to COSMIQUE',
                      style: TextStyle(
                        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                        fontSize: 18.0,
                      ),
                    ),
                  ),

                  // Grid to display ItemCard in a 3 column grid.
                  GridView.count(
                    primary: true,
                    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
                    crossAxisSpacing: 10,
                    mainAxisSpacing: 10,
                    crossAxisCount: 3,
                    // To ensure that the grid fits its height.
                    shrinkWrap: true,

                    // Display ItemCard for each item in the items list.
                    children: items.map((ItemHomepage item) {
                      return ItemCard(item);
                    }).toList(),
                  ),
                ],       
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ),
    );
  }
}
```
